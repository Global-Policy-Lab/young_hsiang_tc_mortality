## Set Up

Scripts provided are written in Stata 14, Matlab 2019a, and R 4.2.0. Note that you will need a Stata 14, R (or Rstudio) version 4.2.0, and Matlab R2019a or higher license to fully replicate the analysis. Throughout this ReadMe, when indicating paths to code and data, it is assumed that youâ€™ll execute scripts from the repo root directory.

To estimate run all the scripts, you will need several packages installed in Stata. To add them, launch Stata and run:

ssc install rsource, replace
ssc install outreg2, replace
net install grc1leg, from(http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/) 

In addition you will need sevaral pacakges intstalled in R. To add them, launch R and run:

install.packages(c("data.table", "dplyr", "magrittr", "reshape2", "ggplot2", "gridExtra", "fields", "akima", "sf", "RColorBrewer", "terra", "raster", "spatstat", "R.matlab", "matlib", "cowplot", "readr", "devtools", "stringr"))

If you do not run from the master do program you will have to run the following commands to create all the subdirectories:

mkdir output

mkdir output/randomization 

mkdir output/beta

mkdir figures

mkdir figures/appendix

Note, set up should only take a few minutes to complete.

## Data Documentation

A detailed description of the data used in this analysis can be found in the Supplementary Information associated with the article.


## Replication Steps

There are five stages to our analysis:

1. Data collection and processing (this step takes a few minutes to run on a normal desktop computer)
2. Regression model estimation (this step takes 3-5 hours to run on a normal desktop computer)
3. Randomization test (this step takes up to a week to run on a normal desktop computer)
4. Mortality burden prediction (this step takes a few minutes to run on a normal desktop computer)
5. Figure creation (this whole step takes around 12-24 hours run on a normal desktop computer)

### Run the full pipeline:

The entire Stata and R pipeline (except the Stata randomization step) can be run by calling:

stata -b do scripts/master.do. 

To run the Matlab scripts that create Figure 1a, Figure SI1 and Figure 3 see instructions below. 

If you would rather do it step by step, see the description of each stage below. 




### 1. Data collection and processing:

All data is available for download here: https://zenodo.org/uploads/10459719. 

The full data processing code is not included but the collected full data set is provided in DATA_hurricane_mortality_temp_month_state_19302015.dta .

We also provide the follow datasets required for the analysis:

- Shapefiles of the U.S. states : cb_2016_us_state_20m
- LICRICE generated TC wind speed and pddi by state and month : panel_by_storm__NA_USA_density_8_yr_1930_2018.csv 
- NOAA TC direct deaths : directdeaths.csv
- Nordhaus TC damages and LICRICE, national : nordhaus_LICRICE_USA_merged.dta
- TC rainfall data : rainfall_idw_state_storm.csv
- CDC mortality data for all states : mortality_19002015.dta (needed for SI figures)
- Counties on the coastline : coastline-counties-list.xlsx (needed for SI figures)
- County population by age : us.1969_2020.19ages.adjusted.txt (needed for SI figures)
- List of TC names : storm_list.txt
- Wind speed and population by pixel : wind_state_pop_export.csv (needed for Figure SI13e)
- LICRICE all storms pixel-level : NA_USA_density_8_yr_1930_2018_storm_specific.mat (needed for Figure SI6)
- Shapefile of US states : plotting_maps/s_11au16/s_11au16.shp (needed for Figure SI1)
- Hurricane direct death data : directdeaths.csv (needed for Figure 3)
- TC unique serial number and storm name : storm_id_name_raw.mat (needed for Figure 3)
- TC unique serial number : stormnamelist.mat (needed for Figure 3)

Preparation of variables (such as creating fixed effects and leads) for the regressions can be generated using the following command:

stata -b do scripts/01-prep-lags.do



### 2. Regression model estimation:

Once data is processed, you can estimate each regression model for all mortality outcomes using the following command:

stata -b do scripts/02-run-regressions.do



### 3. Randomization test

Once the data is processed you can perform the randomization procedure using the following command:

stata -b do scripts/randomization.do

NOTE: This program takes multiple days to run in its entirety. Therefore, we provide the results of the randomization in the output/randomization directory for your convenience. 



### 4. Mortality burden prediction

Once the regression coefficients have been estimated in the above models, you can generate the necessary predictions using 

stata -b do scripts/03-mortality-predictions.do



### 5. Figure creation 

To generate the four figures in the paper, run the following scripts:

matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "plotting_maps; exit;" (note: you need to change the cd path)

stata -b do scripts/04-main-figure1.do

stata -b do scripts/05-main-figure2.do

stata -b do scripts/06-main-figure3.do

matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r "plotting_impulse; exit;" (note: you need to change the cd path)

stata -b do scripts/07-main-figure4.do

R CMD BATCH scripts/08-excess-mortality-maps.R

stata -b do scripts/09-appendix-figures.do

R CMD BATCH scripts/10-appendix-rain-wind-maps.R


You can also run the scripts interactively by opening the corresponding programs and scripts.
